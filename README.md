# Hangman

My 1st Python project.



## Description

Script is a simulation of game of hangman.
To run, please type in console (in script's directory):

```
python3 hangman.py
```
The script uses *wordbank.txt* file, which will contain words to be used in game. Each word should start with a new line, and all characters other than letters will be omitted.
* *wordbank.txt* should be put in script's directory.
* There is an example *wordbank.txt* file provided in repo.
